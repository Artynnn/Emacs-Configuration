#+title: Artyn's Emacs configuration

This is my personal Emacs Configuration. I use Emacs as my "graphical shell" and "integrated computing environment".

/test/

* Features and goals

- *simple*: No custom macros are used for configuration, I just use the common =use-package=. This makes it very easy to grok.

- *featureful*: My Emacs configuration is a integrated computing environment, it supports writing, programming, feed reading, web browsing and file management etc.

* Installation

It has the following requirements:

- POSIX environment (WSL, Linux, OSX). I currently only use Debian and NixOS. AFAIK WSL has problems with linux audio so my =bongo= and =empv.el= configuration cannot be used.
- git
- mpv
- vlc
- wordnet
- ripgrep
- LSP language servers
- hunspell
- compiled Emacs from master branch
- mbsync
- msmtp
- notmuch

finally:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/Artynnn/Emacs-Configuration ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src

* Tips

- Having a compiled Emacs together with =straight.el= means that you can easily contribute to all of Emacs and you get the latest goodies.

- Have a Emacs notes file. This makes it easier to get better at using Emacs and to flesh out ideas that you have.
